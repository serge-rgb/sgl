This is my own C++ standard library. MIT licensed. Things may explode.

Feature list
------------
* NonCopyable base class.
* `Maybe<T>`, my small nod to haskell's sexy type system.
* Stretchy array (substitute for std::vector)
* Scoped pointer
* String class
* 
### Planned features.

* Modern OpenGL helpers (It would be nice to draw a triangle to the screen using less than 1000 lines)
* Refcounted pointer

Purposes
--------
1. Avoid the stl.
2. Provide common functionality for the kind of coding that I do (Graphics, at the moment).

Motivations
-----------
1. I enjoy reinventing wheels.
2. My eyes bleed when looking at stl implementations.
3. I enjoy reinventing wheels.
